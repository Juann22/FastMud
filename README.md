# FastMud

Maybe you've already thought the following:

> "If glass bottles can turn dirt into mud, then why doesn't a bucket of water work? Wouldn't it make more sense if running water could make mud? 🤔"

And it was thinking a lot about this, spending a lot of time, that I decided to create this plugin for a personal logic correction, and I decided to share it with you 😁

## 🎉 Features

- When player uses water bucket.
- When water flows.
